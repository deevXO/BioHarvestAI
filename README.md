## 1. Introduction

BioHarvest AI is a groundbreaking Generative AI platform designed to revolutionize sustainable agriculture. We empower plant scientists and breeders to combat climate change by accelerating the creation of resilient and resource-efficient crop varieties.

This repository contains the **main frontend application and orchestration logic** for BioHarvest AI.  
The core AI processing and backend services are hosted in a separate repository.

## 2. Vision & Problem Solved

**Our Vision:**  
To be the world's leading Generative AI Platform for Sustainable Crop Design, transforming traditional agriculture into a rapid, proactive, and scientifically guided engineering discipline.

**Problems BioHarvest AI Solves:**

1. **Climate Crisis Impact:** Rapid climate shifts (droughts, floods, heat, new pests) devastate global crop yields, leading to food insecurity and environmental degradation.  
2. **Slow Adaptation:** Traditional crop breeding takes 10‚Äì15+ years, critically insufficient for rapid climate adaptation.  
3. **Fragmented Genetic Design:** Existing tools are disconnected, relying on guesswork rather than integrated, AI-driven solutions for proactive mutation design and validation.  

BioHarvest AI addresses these by providing an integrated, AI-driven solution that accelerates genetic adaptation, ensuring stable food supplies and a healthier environment for all.

## 3. Features

- **Generative Mutation Optimization:** AI proactively designs novel, optimal genetic mutations for specific climate-resilience traits.  
- **Holistic Multi-Trait Impact Analysis:** Predicts complex effects and crucial trade-offs across multiple sustainability metrics (e.g., drought tolerance, water use efficiency, carbon sequestration).  
- **Cognitive Explanation (XAI Core):** Provides mechanistic reasoning for AI predictions, linked to scientific principles and literature for enhanced trust.  
- **Interactive Bio-Visualizers:** Real-time sequence highlighting, dynamic 3D protein structure visualization, and pathway mapping.  
- **Cross-Species Transfer Predictor:** Estimates the likelihood of beneficial mutations being effective in other crop species.  
- **(Future) In-Silico Lab Assistant:** AI-guided CRISPR design, automated experimental protocols, and resource optimization.  
- **Intuitive "Cognitive Bio-Interface":** A user-friendly web dashboard for seamless interaction with complex genetic data and AI.

## 4. Architecture Overview

BioHarvest AI operates on a **modular, distributed architecture**. This repository primarily houses the **Frontend/Client-side application**.

**System Components:**

1. **Frontend (This Repository):** Interactive web dashboard and client-side logic built with Next.js, React, TypeScript.  
2. **Backend AI & Services (Separate Repo):** Python-based FastAPI server hosting core AI models (LLMs), processing genetic data, and providing API endpoints.  
3. **External Data Sources (Optional):** Public biological databases (UniProt, NCBI, PDB) and potentially real-time sensor data (future scope).

## 5. Getting Started (Frontend)

These instructions will help you set up and run the **BioHarvest AI frontend** on your local machine.  
You must also have the **backend services running** (see BioHarvest AI Backend repo).

### 5.1 Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS: 18.x or 20.x)  
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn  
- Git  
- Running BioHarvest AI Backend services  

### 5.2 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deevXO/BioHarvestAI.git
cd BioHarvestAI

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
````

### 5.3 Configuration

The frontend needs to know where your backend services are running.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
# Or your deployed backend URL, e.g. https://api.bioharvest.ai/api
```

Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` points to the backend service.

### 5.4 Running the Application

```bash
# Start the frontend dev server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open: **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## 6. Usage

Once connected to the backend, you can:

* üîç **Explore Crop Genes:** Search and filter a gene library for climate resilience.
* üß¨ **Design Mutations:** Input or auto-generate optimal mutation candidates.
* üìä **Predict Impact:** Get AI-powered predictions across sustainability traits.
* üìñ **Validate Insights:** Review mechanistic explanations, compare variants, assess cross-species transferability.
* üß™ **(Future) Plan Experiments:** Generate AI-guided CRISPR designs and experimental protocols.
