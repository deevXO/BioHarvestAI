    },
    xaiExplanation: "The A120V mutation enhances DNA binding affinity by 34% through improved hydrophobic interactions in the AP2 domain. This strengthens transcriptional activation of downstream stress-response genes, particularly those involved in osmotic adjustment and cellular protection. The valine substitution creates a more stable protein conformation under stress conditions, leading to sustained drought tolerance even at 40Â°C ambient temperature.",

    xaiExplanation: "The G87A mutation significantly improves salt exclusion mechanisms by altering the selectivity filter of the Na+/H+ exchanger. This reduces cytotoxic sodium accumulation by 67% while maintaining essential potassium levels. The alanine substitution stabilizes the transmembrane domain, enabling sustained function even at 200mM NaCl concentrations that would typically cause cellular damage.",
